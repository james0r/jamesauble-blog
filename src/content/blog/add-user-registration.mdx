> Next.js 14 is the latest release at the time of this writing.

After moving to React from Vue a couple years back, in 2023 I finally took a deep dive into Next.js. It was probably a chaotic time to jump into the framework, but offered a chance to experience several new features such as Partial Pre-rendering, @next/font, Turbopack, and all the new functionality that came with the new app router.

As unsettling as learning a new framework can be after using something else for years, I'm always excited to see people improving approaches and tools that allow us to develop, ship, and maintain great websites.

</HeaderLink>

If you're a total beginner to Next.js or want to learn what the latest version offers, Next offers a 16 chapter tutorial called Next Learn that "brings you from React to Next.js". Therefore, it's a good idea to have foundational knowledge of React before you begin Next Learn.

This post is a supplemental to Next Learn though, so if you have yet to complete Next Learn, go and complete the course before continuing on.

> I always recommend trying to achieve something like this yourself and see how far you can get. I believe that the pain of trying is like a sledgehammer to your memory and is a necessary part of evolving as a developer. That said, sometimes checking out a solution, at least partially, can help you past a hurdle and keep you in the game.

### Create Files

We need to create the following files and folders for our UI and Page so let's do that now. Create the following files:

- /app/ui/register-form.tsx
- /app/register/page.tsx

The rest of our work will be in existing files.

## Register Form

Aside from renaming identifiers from "login" to "register", our `register-form.tsx` will mostly be borrowed from `/app/ui/login-form.tsx` with the exception of two new additional input elements for name (Full Name) and our password confirmation.

```tsx
'use client';

import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import {
  AtSymbolIcon,
  KeyIcon,
  ExclamationCircleIcon,
  UserIcon
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/20/solid';
import { Button } from './button';
import { useFormState, useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';
import { register } from '@/app/lib/actions';

export default function RegisterForm() {
  const [errorMessage, formAction] = useFormState(register, null);

  return (
    <form action={formAction} className="space-y-3">
      <div className="flex-1 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 px-6 pb-4 pt-8">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-3 text-2xl`}>
          Register by email.
        </h1>
        <div className="w-full">
          <div>
            <label
              className="mb-3 mt-5 block text-xs font-medium text-gray-900"
              htmlFor="name"
            >
              Full Name
            </label>
            <div className="relative">
              <input
                className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
                id="name"
                type="text"
                name="name"
                placeholder="Enter your full name"
                required
              />
              <UserIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />

            <div className="relative">

                id="password"
                type="password"
                name="password"
                placeholder="Enter password"
                required
                minLength={6}
              />
              <KeyIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-4">
            <label
              className="mb-3 mt-5 block text-xs font-medium text-gray-900"
              htmlFor="confirm-password"
            >
              Confirm Password
            </label>
            <div className="relative">
              <input
                className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
                id="confirm-password"
                type="password"
                name="confirm-password"
                placeholder="Enter password"
                required
                minLength={6}
              />
              <KeyIcon className="pointer-events-none absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <RegisterButton />
        <div
          className="flex h-8 items-end space-x-1"
          aria-live="polite"
          aria-atomic="true"
        >
          {errorMessage && (
            <>
              <ExclamationCircleIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-red-500" />
              <p className="text-sm text-red-500">{errorMessage}</p>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}

function RegisterButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <Button className="mt-4 w-full" aria-disabled={pending}>
      Register <ArrowRightIcon className="ml-auto h-5 w-5 text-gray-50" />
    </Button>
  );
}
```

We're not using this anywhere yet so let's create our page route for /register.

### Register Page Route

Our /register page route file will look almost identical to our /login route file, but will instead import the Register Form we set up above.

Paste the following in /app/register/page.tsx:

```tsx
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import RegisterForm from '@/app/ui/register-form';
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import Link from 'next/link'
 
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Register',
};
 
export default function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex items-center justify-center md:h-screen">
      <div className="relative mx-auto flex w-full max-w-[400px] flex-col space-y-2.5 p-4 md:-mt-32">
        <div className="flex h-20 w-full items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-3 md:h-36">
          <div className="w-32 text-white md:w-36">
            <Link href="/">
              <AcmeLogo />
            </Link>
          </div>
        </div>
        <RegisterForm />
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Navigate to the /register route and you should now see our new register form UI.

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

<Image 
  src="/registration-dialog.avif" 
  alt="registration dialog box" 
  width="935"
  height="577"
  />

<HeaderLink id="register-action" tag="h3">
### Register Action
</HeaderLink>

Just as we did with all the other forms in our Next Learn dashboard app, we need to create an action to handle the register form submission. Open up /app/lib/actions.ts and let's take a look at the action handler `createInvoice()`.

You may be thinking "why aren't we just referencing the authenticate action handler because this is what login-form.tsx uses".

The reason is that the authenticate handler is special because all it really does is leverage Auth.js's `signIn()` function, whereas with our register form we're not employing Auth.js and instead just validating our form data and storing our new user in the database. That's more similar to our `createInvoice()` function.

In /app/lib/actions.ts let's add a zod object for our formData coming from our register form.

```ts
...
// imports

const RegisterUser = z.object({
  name: z.string({
    invalid_type_error: 'Please enter your name.',
  }),
  email: z.string({
    invalid_type_error: 'Please enter an email address.',
  }),
  password: z.string({
    invalid_type_error: 'Please enter a password.',
  }),
  confirmPassword: z.string({
    invalid_type_error: 'Please confirm your password.',
  }),
})

...
```

Zod should already be imported as `z` so we're good to go with that.

However, we need a couple new imports because we'll be encrypting our user's password that choose in the register form and also setting a UUID that is used as the PRIMARY KEY in our users database table.

Add these below your existing imports

```ts
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

Okay great, now it's time to define our register form action handler.

In pseudo code we're going to be doing the following logic:

1. Validating our formData with zod
2. Return an error if it formData fails to validate
3. Hash our password with bcrypt
4. Create a UUID
5. INSERT our new user in the users database table
6. Redirect to /login if all is successful

In `/app/lib/actions.ts` and below our zod object we used above, paste in our function definition for our register action handler:

```ts
export async function register(
  prevState: string | null,
  formData: FormData,
) {

  const validatedFields = RegisterUser.safeParse({
    name: formData.get('name'),
    email: formData.get('email'),
    password: formData.get('password'),
    confirmPassword: formData.get('confirm-password'),
  })

  // If form validation fails, return errors early. Otherwise, continue.
  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return "Missing Fields. Failed to Create Account."
  }

  const { name, email, password, confirmPassword } = validatedFields.data

  // Check if passwords match
  if (password !== confirmPassword) {
    return "Passwords don't match."
  }

  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10)
  const id = uuidv4()

  try {
    await sql`
      INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, password)
      VALUES (${id}, ${name}, ${email}, ${hashedPassword})
    `
  } catch (error) {
    return "Database Error: Failed to Create Account."
  }

  redirect('/login')
}
```

Reload your /register route in the browser and try it out.

The markup for the form we created used client-side browser field validation, but if you enter a mismatched password, you'll get a more specific error sent back in the response from our server action.

Hope you enjoyed this final post of 2023.
